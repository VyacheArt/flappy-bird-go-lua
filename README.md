# Description

This is a simple example of integrating Lua "mods" into the Flappy Bird game. 

This example is created for the YouTube video.

`my-mod.lua` displays the DVD-like floating logo "VyacheArt". It's just an example, so it doesn't have API, conventions 
or anything else which could be called "final". So feel free to make a final solution in your project.  

Hope my work will help you!
